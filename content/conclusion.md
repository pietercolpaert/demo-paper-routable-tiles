### What is the benefit of publishing geospatial data as Linked Open Data?

It is particularly difficult to 

  * Federation
  * lower server costs thanks to caching
  * Specific end-user needs can be done on the client-side
  *

Still optimizations can be done such as applying transfer patterns on public transport data, 

With the increase in CPU power and bandwidth of end-user devices, we can imagine that end-user devices become more intelligent and perform user-specific algorithms on the client rather than having to rely on server functionality.

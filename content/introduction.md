## Introduction

When setting up a new journey planner on the Web taking into account individual user needs, developers are quickly confronted with the daunting aspects of integrating heterogeneous datasets.
Industry players provide solutions to this mess, by providing services on top of their datasets that are centralized in one location.
They are able to provide a solution for 80% (based on the Pareto principle) and build a business around that.
However, we can imagine the industry route planners are not going to find a solid business model to keep integrating datasets that may benefit any individual user that is part of the other 20%.

Take for example use case where people want to calculate trips for:

 * Companies trying to find an optimal delivery route for their bike delivery services
 * A foldable bike manufacturer that wants to include 

All that would be needed however is an adapted weight calculation based on these datasets.
In this paper, we introduce “Routable Tiles”.
We republished all the road in Open Street Map using a tiling mechanism that exploits Open Data principles.

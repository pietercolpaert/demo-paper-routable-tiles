    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <!-- Context      -->
    <p>Today, route planning providers manually integrate different geo-spatial datasets 
before offering a Web service to developers, thus creating a closed world view. 
In contrast, combining open datasets at runtime 
can provide more information for user-specific route planning needs. 
For example, an extra dataset of bike sharing availabilities 
may provide more relevant information to the occasional cyclist.
<!-- Need         -->
A strategy for automating the adoption of open geo-spatial datasets is needed 
to allow an ecosystem of route planners able to answer more specific and complex queries. 
This rises new challenges such us 
(i) how open geo-spatial datasets should be published on the Web to raise interoperability, 
and (ii) how route planners can discover and integrate relevant data for a certain query on the fly.
<!-- Task         --> 
We republished Open Street Map’s road network as “Routable Tiles”
to facilitate its integration into open route planners.
To achieve this, we use a Linked Data strategy and follow an approach similar to vector tiles.
<!-- Object       -->
In a demo, we show how client-side code can automatically discover tiles and perform a shortest path algorithm.
<!-- Findings     -->
We provide four contributions: (i) we launched an open geo-spatial dataset that is available for everyone to reuse at no cost, (ii) we published a Linked Data version of the Open Street Map ontology, (iii) we introduced a hypermedia specification for vector tiles that extends the Hydra ontology, and (iv) we released the mapping scripts, demo and routing scripts as open source software.
<!-- Conclusion and Perspectives -->
The preliminary conclusions of this work put forward more questions than answers: 
are existing RDF serializations compact enough for an acceptable user experience? 
What happens when another dataset needs to introduce new nodes that are not in the base map? 
Can other hypermedia structures be thought of?</p>

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>When setting up a new journey planner on the Web taking into account individual user needs, developers are quickly confronted with the daunting aspects of integrating heterogeneous datasets.
Industry players provide solutions to this mess, by providing services on top of their datasets that are centralized in one location.
They are able to provide a solution for 80% (based on the Pareto principle) and build a business around that.
Industry route planners are not going to find a solid business model to keep integrating datasets that may benefit any individual user of the remaining 20%.</p>

      <p>Take for example use cases where people want to calculate trips for:
people owning a foldable bike that can take their bike on public transport,
companies trying to find an optimal delivery route for their delivery service where some vehicles cannot pass through low emission zones,
routes based on the probability and real-time state of traffic control systems to hit a red light,
people with special constraints based on a disability.</p>

      <p>For each of these use cases, extra datasets are needed to calculate these end-user specific routing graph.
These datasets are published by different organizations that often publish their data openly thanks to legal constraints or strategic goals.
Every route planner will somehow need to compile their own sources which they want to take into account.</p>

      <p>In this paper, we aim to automate data adoption in route planners, and as a first step decided to introduce “Routable Tiles”.
Routable Tiles is a specification in which we republished all the roads in Open Street Map using a tiling mechanism that exploits Open Data principles.
In the next chapter we will see that the ideas behind Routable Tiles is not that novel, yet somehow publishing routable tiles for clients to consume has not been done before.
After introducing the ontology, specification and server software, we demonstrate what now becomes possible in an in-browser demo.
The browser itself can perform a routing algorithm on the client-side, and every step in the routing algorithm can involve other weights and datasets as it pleases.
This first prototype exploiting Open Data principles probably introduces more questions than answers.</p>

It takes a strong position in favor of HTTP URIs to identify resources.
The rationale is that Linked Data and the use of HTTP URIs as global identifiers, raises the interoperability.
Raising the semantic interoperability of datasets in turn promises a higher</p>

      <p>Slippy maps are maps often included in web-pages on which you can pan around.
In order to reduce server load, the client is preconfigured with a URL template of the web-server containing image tiles.
E.g., <code>https:/​/​{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png</code>, where <code>s</code> denotes a subdomain to be used, <code>z</code> the zoom-level the slippy map is at, and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the coordinates of the upper left corner of the tile.
When the map is loaded, the client can calculate all URLs necessary.
Vector tiles reuse this idea, yet instead of raster images, it publishes the raw data behind the tile.
The client can then render the maps on the client-side.
This gives clear benefits over raster images:
 (i) the styling of the maps can be done by UI developers that can use CSS and scripts to style the road elements,
 (ii) vector tiles can be smaller in size as vectors are typically much smaller than a rendered bitmap, and
 (iii) it allows for all elements on the map to become interactive.
Existing implementations include the Mapbox vector tiles and Open Map Tiles.
Each have their own specificities and schemas (see <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/mapbox-streets-v8/">https:/​/​docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/mapbox-streets-v8/</a> and <a href="https://openmaptiles.org/schema/">https:/​/​openmaptiles.org/schema/</a>) with a strong focus on rendering maps.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla">Valhalla by Mapzen and now hosted by the Linux Foundation</a> is the first project that implements the idea of vector tiles for route planners in an open-source project.
The technology proposes a <a href="https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/docs/tiles.md">tiling specification</a> for storing routing information on disk.
Tiling the data makes sure the server can be selective about the data that needs to be loaded into memory in order to execute an individual request.
This tiling specification in Valhalla is however not used as an exchange format – although offline routing is an upcoming feature – and interoperability with other datasets is not a focus.</p>

      <h3 id="open-data-publishing">Open Data publishing</h3>

      <p>Open Data can be published in various interfaces.
In order to be able to query these interfaces, <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00668-6_15"><a href="https://comunica.github.io/Article-ISWC2018-Resource/">Comunica</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span> was built.
It is a Linked Data user agent that can run federated queries over several heterogeneous Web APIs, such as data dumps, SPARQL endpoints, Linked Data documents and <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2016.03.003"><a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/publications/jws2016.pdf">Triple Pattern Fragments</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>.
This engine has been developed to make it easy to plug in specific types of functionality as separate modules. Such modules can be added or removed depending on the configuration. As such, by looking for affordances in Web APIs more intelligent user agents can be created.
Preconditions for an engine like Comunica to work with your dataset is: supporting a Linked Data representation and allowing cross origin resource sharing headers in the HTTP responses.
The better the data is split in fragments, the better the caching will be able to provide a faster user-perceived performance.</p>

      <p>For public transport systems, instead of publishing a dump of time schedules or a full fletched route planner, <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1486/paper_28.pdf">Linked Connections</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span> proposes a publishing mechanism that gives clients access to the data in time fragments.
It uses departure-arrival pairs from a station to another (a connection), and orders these connections by departure time.
It then fragments this dataset in documents that can be published over HTTP.
Links in the responses ensure a client can always find more information to take into account.</p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>

      <h3 id="the-specification">The Specification</h3>

      <p>Routable Tiles is a JSON-LD specification and the draft can be found at <a href="https://openplanner.team/specs/2018-11-routable-tiles.html">https:/​/​openplanner.team/specs/2018-11-routable-tiles.html</a>
It has several aspects:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>It introduces a hypermedia specification reusing Hydra Collections for describing a tile server</li>
        <li>For a server to be compliant to routable tiles, nodes, ways and restrictions needs to be modeled.</li>
        <li>It introduces a mapping of the Open Street Map terms to an RDFS vocabulary</li>
      </ol>

      <h4 id="hypermedia">Hypermedia</h4>

      <p>While in the geospatial world, standards such as WMS, WFS, … seek for strict contracts between servers and agents,
in the Linked Open Data world, hypermedia controls are used to express what building blocks are supported by the server.
From every document, another document can be reached by interpreting the metadata.
Intelligent agents crawl over this data in order to find answers to queries.</p>

<figcaption><span class="label">Fig. 2:</span> An example of two  Ways, a couple of Nodes, one containing a bollard, and a restriction to turn right.</figcaption>
</figure>

      <p>We define 3 main classes: osm:Way, osm:Relation, osm:Node.</p>

      <p>The osm:members describe the members of the relation and the osm:role their function in the relation.</p>

      <p>osm:restriction is used to model turn restrictions. There are <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:restriction">9 possibilities as a range</a>:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>osm:no_left_turn</li>
        <li>osm:no_right_turn</li>
        <li>osm:no_straight_on</li>
        <li>osm:no_u_turn</li>
        <li>osm:only_right_turn</li>
        <li>osm:only_left_turn</li>
        <li>osm:only_straight_on</li>
        <li>osm:no_entry</li>
        <li>osm:no_exit</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The property osm:nodes is used to link to an rdf:List of osm:Node items.
In one page, multiple lists can be described.
If a Way crosses a tile, the other tile also mentioned the border Node in one of its rdf:Lists.
The property osm:members is used to link to an rdf:List of osm:Member items.</p>

      <h3 id="the-server">The Server</h3>

      <p>The mapping scripts and server interface can be found at <a href="https://github.com/openplannerteam/routeable-tiles">https:/​/​github.com/openplannerteam/routeable-tiles</a>.
Every tile in Open Street Map on zoom level 14 is on the fly made available as JSON-LD.
Special attention was given to the HTTP server to include a server-side cache and to compress the HTTP response with gzip.
Furthermore, it sets both an etag header and a cache-control max-age header for client-side cache control.
Finally, it also allows webpages on other domains to request its data by setting the appropriate Cross Origin Resource Sharing headers.</p>

      <p>Due to <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/862">a recent change in the WhatWG fetch specification</a>, there is also a need for supporting the OPTIONS method, that specifically allows all headers in its response.</p>

      <p>For the URIs of Ways and Nodes, we decided to reuse the subject pages provided by the Open Street Map project itself.
We hope that at some point, Open Street Map decides to support a Linked Data representation on these URIs.
For example: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/366934331">https:/​/​www.openstreetmap.org/node/366934331</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/242536619">https:/​/​www.openstreetmap.org/way/242536619</a>.</p>

</figure>

      <p>The data is used for rendering the map as well as routing.
As every tile contains global identifiers for each Way, Node and Relation, these identifiers can be reused by third parties.
Furthermore, the properties that are added on top of these resources can share properties, and automated alignment through reasoning can enrich the existing data.
We discuss the open challenges in the last chapter.</p>

  <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion and discussion</h2>

      <p>In this paper, we introduced a specification for publishing Open Street Map’s roads as Linked Open Data following the ideas behind <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2016.03.003"><a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/publications/jws2016.pdf">Linked Data Fragments</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>.
We conclude with a list of benefits and open issues on this approach.</p>

      <p>Firstly, the server costs are lower as it does not have to answer any individual routing request.
Instead it sends the data itself to the client that needs to perform the algorithm itself.
The URLs that are requested are the same thanks to the hypermedia controls and HTTP caching can be leveraged.
Next to the fact that server-costs become limited, it also gives flexibility to developers using the data.
They do not have to contact the server-administrators of these open datasets for new features to add.
Just like vector tiles styling, they can tailor the routing algorithm to their end-user needs in the browser.</p>

      <p>This also gives the benefit that not one server has to contain all of the world’s data.
It opens the door to use cases where source selection also happens on the client and multiple sources are queried at once.
Also for use cases outside the routing domain, routable tiles becomes useful.
The hypermedia controls can be added as an <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00668-6_15"><a href="https://comunica.github.io/Article-ISWC2018-Resource/">actor to Comunica (future work for now)</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span> and help it solve geospatial queries over any data source by downloading only the right tiles.</p>

      <p>A precondition in order to be queryable by Comunica, is that the data is available in an RDF serialization.
As we use JSON-LD with well thought-out context, this data can be serialized into usable RDF.
However, an open issue is still whether the Linked Data model as such is useful.
For example, when another source wants to do a statement about a part of a road that is not yet an osm:Way instance, how will this data be interoperable with this dataset?</p>

      <p>In future work, we will benchmark the different in size and performance between Valhalla tiles (protobuf) and Routable Tiles (JSON-LD + gzip).
Maybe there will be a need in the future for routable tiles specification that supports a binary format in order to reduce size.</p>

      <p>In  general, still a lot of optimizations can be done, such as applying contraction hierarchies and exposing data on multiple zoom levels.</p>
